Evolution of vortex strength, determined using circulation, and distribution of vortices, determined using contours of helicity, are also compared. Results show that secondary vortices emerge stronger, and lift-off rates drop, with the introduction of slot (slotted micro vortex generator) or gaps (split-ramp micro vortex generator). Near-surface contours of axial velocity, and integral properties of the boundary layer are then compared to evaluate the effects of the evolution of the vortical structures on the flow field. Results shows that the split-ramp device results in the most energetic near-surface flow, but the worst outgoing boundary-layer integral properties, while the slotted-ramp devices with taper fares well on both counts.

These devices introduce a set of co-rotating or counter-rotating vortex pairs into the flow, which are considered to make the streamwise velocity profile fuller (near the wall), effectively increasing the ability of the flow to withstand higher adverse pressure gradient without undergoing separation. A sub-class of vortex generators is the ramp-type or wedge-shaped vortex generator (other being vane type) that produces a counter-rotating vortex pair.\nIn the flow-field downstream of a ramp-type vortex-generator, as the counter-rotating vortex pair is advected by the mean flow, it is lifted off due to the mutual up wash. To an extent, the effectiveness of these vortices depends on how fast these vortices lift off, as vortices that lift off at a slower rate remain closer to the wall over longer distance downstream of the device trailing edge, and potentially have a greater energizing effect on the near wall flow. In this work, the evolution of the primary vortex pair downstream of vortex generators placed in a supersonic stream is compared using a swirl center tracking technique, for standard, slotted, and split-ramp type vortex generators.\n","date":1461695400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461695400,"objectID":"746e821f89334ca7903874e789470436","permalink":"https://jatinderpal.com/project/vortexgenerator/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00+05:30","relpermalink":"/project/vortexgenerator/","section":"project","summary":"Evaluation of Ramp-Type Micro Vortex Generators Using Swirl Center Tracking.","tags":["vortex-generator"],"title":"Vortex Generator","type":"project"}]
